# DIYFB 1.0 - A DIY FingBox AutoApps Project (Project Closed)

## DIYFB does not give the same experience as a FingBox!!

DIYFB provides automatic scanning and Fing alerts and much more! (even if you are in another network)

## NOTE: If you have Fing Desktop, you may not be able to scan the network from Fing on Android, Fing links Fing Desktop to scan FingBox style, this if you leave the PC always on, it is another alternative to FingBox and DIYFB.
